##  Unobstructed Rect Sweep Line Algorithm
Given a rectangle (self) and a list of obstructions (other_rects), this algorithm returns all sub-rectangles that are not covered by an obstruction.

This algorithm has been moved to [rect-lib](https://github.com/5-pebbles/rect-lib); for more information, see its [documentation](https://github.com/5-pebbles/rect-lib/blob/main/algorithms/unobstructed_subrectangles.md).
